Python Solutions for Advent of Code 2023

Many of the solutions are from the subreddit, this is my first time solving these kinds of problems with Python.
I am using this event as an opportunity to learn how to program better in Python.
Shoutout to 4HbQ on Reddit, a lot of your solutions were concise with good short explanations and helped me learn.
Reference links are included in comments of the files.
